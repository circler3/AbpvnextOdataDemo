# AbpvnextOdataDemo
This project illustrates a simple approach towards ABP VNEXT working with ODATA. I think it is a side-by-side implementation.

## Introduction
ABP VNEXT project does not provide a nuget package supporting OData. You should setup everything by yourself. Template ABP VNEXT project is the tutorial project(generated by abp cli) in ABP.IO.

ABP VNEXT uses auto-generated WebAPI controller mechanism and hense I write a custom controller to configure 0Data and route it manually.

## Usage
Set `TodoApp.HttpApi.Api.Host` as starting project and run.

GET `/api/TodoAppImpl` to start an OData Query. e.g. `/api/TodoAppImpl?$count=true`.
Visit `api/$metadata#TodoAppImpl` to get edm schema of the DTO.

## Disclaimer
This project is just a demo. It is not well designed in OData part. **Never** use it in production.

I will write posts on this approach.

There are several [posts(Chinese)](https://www.cnblogs.com/podolski/collections/961) about OData which might be helpful for leveraging OData.
